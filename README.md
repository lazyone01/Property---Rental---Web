# Property---Rental---Web


A modern, user-friendly web application for property owners and renters to list, browse, and manage rental properties with ease.

## ​​ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js — fast, flexible, and lightweight server framework  
- **Templating**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) — server-side rendering of views  
- **Views & Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript — interactive and responsive user interface  
- **Database**: *(Add your DB here — e.g., MongoDB with Mongoose / MySQL / PostgreSQL)*  
- **Models**: Modular MVC structure using models under the `models/` folder  

  
##  Project Idea & Goals

Build a full-stack web application where:

1. **Property owners** can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) rental property listings.
2. **Renters/users** can browse, filter, and view details of available properties.
3. Potential enhancements:
 - **Authentication**: Sign-up/login for owners and renters (e.g., using Passport or JWT)
 - **Authorization**: Secure access—owners manage only their listings
 - **Search & filters**: Find properties by location, price, features
 - **Image uploads**: Owners can upload photos (e.g., via Multer + cloud storage)
 - **Bookings or inquiries**: Renters can request bookings or message owners
 - **Map integration**: Display property locations visually (e.g., Google Maps or Leaflet)
